# RAPassignment - package

This file gives a short description to the RAPassignment-package.

This package allows to easily access a simple tibble containing information on all discovered exoplanets up until 2021.
It contains a function that breaks the full dataset down to a simpler version (with the full dataset also available in the package), in order to make it more accessible to newbies
in the domain of exoplanets. 

To get a neat plot on the basis of this package, please have a look at the "Exoplanet_docker" repo!
